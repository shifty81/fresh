# Viewport Utilization Fix for World Creation

## Problem Statement

The viewport was not being properly utilized when creating a new world. Even though validation was performed before world creation, the DirectX swap chain was not configured to use the viewport until AFTER world creation completed. This meant that any rendering happening during chunk generation could target the wrong render surface (the main window instead of the viewport).

## Root Cause

The issue was in the timing of swap chain configuration:

1. **Previous behavior**:
   - Viewport dimensions were validated before world creation
   - If dimensions were invalid, `onWindowResize()` was called to fix them
   - World was created and chunks generated
   - **THEN** swap chain was configured in `initializeGameSystems()`

2. **Problem**:
   - Between world creation start and `initializeGameSystems()`, the swap chain might not be configured for the viewport
   - Any rendering during chunk generation could use the wrong render target
   - Even if dimensions were validated, the swap chain wasn't actually updated to use those dimensions

## Solution

Configure the swap chain for the viewport **BEFORE** world creation begins:

### Changes Made

#### In `Engine::createNewWorld()` (lines 481-505)

Added swap chain configuration immediately after dimension validation:

```cpp
// CRITICAL: Now that dimensions are validated, ensure the swap chain is configured for the viewport
// This must happen BEFORE world creation so rendering during chunk generation uses the viewport
HWND viewportHwnd = viewportPanel->getHandle();
if (viewportHwnd && vpWidth > 0 && vpHeight > 0) {
    LOG_INFO_C("Configuring viewport swap chain BEFORE world creation - viewport size: " + 
               std::to_string(vpWidth) + "x" + std::to_string(vpHeight), "Engine");
    
    // Set viewport window handle and recreate swap chain
    if (m_renderer->setViewportWindow(viewportHwnd)) {
        if (m_renderer->recreateSwapChain(vpWidth, vpHeight)) {
            LOG_INFO_C("✓ Viewport swap chain configured before world creation: " + 
                       std::to_string(vpWidth) + "x" + std::to_string(vpHeight), "Engine");
            std::cout << "✓ Viewport ready for rendering: " << vpWidth << "x" << vpHeight << std::endl;
        } else {
            LOG_ERROR_C("Failed to recreate swap chain before world creation. Rendering may be incorrect.", "Engine");
            std::cerr << "WARNING: Swap chain recreation failed - viewport may not render correctly" << std::endl;
        }
    } else {
        LOG_ERROR_C("Failed to set viewport window handle before world creation.", "Engine");
        std::cerr << "WARNING: Could not set viewport handle - viewport may not render correctly" << std::endl;
    }
} else {
    LOG_WARNING_C("Skipping swap chain configuration before world creation - invalid viewport state", "Engine");
}
```

#### Updated `Engine::initializeGameSystems()` (lines 815-834)

Changed the logging to reflect that this is now a re-validation, not the initial configuration:

```cpp
LOG_INFO_C("Re-validating viewport swap chain after world creation - viewport size: " + 
           std::to_string(vpWidth) + "x" + std::to_string(vpHeight), "Engine");
std::cout << "Re-validating viewport rendering: " << vpWidth << "x" << vpHeight << std::endl;

// Re-confirm viewport window handle in renderer (should already be set from pre-world-creation)
// but we do it again to be absolutely safe in case anything changed
LOG_INFO_C("Re-confirming viewport window handle in renderer...", "Engine");
if (m_renderer->setViewportWindow(viewportHwnd)) {
    LOG_INFO_C("Viewport window handle confirmed. Ensuring swap chain is current...", "Engine");
    // Recreate swap chain for viewport to ensure it's fresh after world creation
    if (m_renderer->recreateSwapChain(vpWidth, vpHeight)) {
        LOG_INFO_C("DirectX swap chain verified and recreated for viewport after world creation", "Engine");
        std::cout << "✓ Viewport swap chain re-verified: " << vpWidth << "x" << vpHeight << std::endl;
```

## Benefits

1. **Proper viewport utilization from start**: The swap chain is configured before world creation begins
2. **Correct rendering during chunk generation**: Any rendering that happens while generating chunks will use the viewport
3. **Belt-and-suspenders approach**: The swap chain is configured both before AND after world creation for maximum reliability
4. **Better error handling**: Clear logging at each step to diagnose any issues
5. **Prevents full-screen rendering**: The viewport is guaranteed to be the render target, not the main window

## Testing Verification

### What to Look For

1. **Log Output**: When creating a new world, you should see:
   ```
   Pre-world-creation viewport check: [width]x[height]
   Configuring viewport swap chain BEFORE world creation - viewport size: [width]x[height]
   ✓ Viewport swap chain configured before world creation: [width]x[height]
   ✓ Viewport ready for rendering: [width]x[height]
   [world generation logs...]
   Re-validating viewport swap chain after world creation - viewport size: [width]x[height]
   ✓ Viewport swap chain re-verified: [width]x[height]
   ```

2. **Visual Verification**:
   - World should render ONLY within the center viewport panel
   - GUI panels should remain visible during and after world creation
   - No full-screen rendering should occur
   - Viewport should scale correctly with window resizing

3. **Edge Cases**:
   - If viewport dimensions are initially invalid, the fix should trigger and valid dimensions should be logged
   - Multiple world creations in a row should all use the viewport correctly

## Technical Details

### Execution Flow

1. User clicks "File > New Scene" and fills in world details
2. `Engine::createNewWorld()` is called
3. **NEW**: Viewport dimensions validated and swap chain configured (lines 441-505)
4. VoxelWorld created and chunks generated (lines 507-540)
5. `Engine::initializeGameSystems()` called (line 650+)
6. **UPDATED**: Swap chain re-validated and recreated (lines 801-867)
7. Editor set visible and panels refreshed

### Why Both Before AND After?

- **Before**: Ensures rendering during chunk generation uses the viewport
- **After**: Ensures the configuration is still correct after world creation completes
- This belt-and-suspenders approach maximizes reliability

### Relationship to Previous Fixes

This fix builds on previous viewport-related fixes:

- **Dimension validation**: Already existed, now includes swap chain configuration
- **Z-order management**: Still happens after swap chain recreation
- **Panel refresh**: Still happens after editor is made visible

## Files Modified

- `src/core/Engine.cpp`: Added swap chain configuration before world creation (lines 481-505) and updated post-creation validation (lines 815-834)

- Repository memory: "swap chain recreation order"

## Future Improvements

1. Consider caching valid viewport dimensions as a fallback
2. Add more robust error recovery if swap chain creation fails
3. Consider hiding the viewport during chunk generation to prevent partial rendering
4. Add telemetry to track viewport configuration success rate

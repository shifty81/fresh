- Manual save with Ctrl+S
- Compressed chunk data
- Fast loading with streaming
- Saves stored in `saves/` directory

## 🛠️ Technical Architecture

### C++20 Core Engine
The engine uses modern C++20 features:
- **Modules** (where supported by compiler)
- **Concepts** for template constraints
- **Ranges** for efficient iteration
- **Coroutines** for async operations
- **std::format** for string formatting

### .NET 9 Bindings (Optional)
C# developers can use .NET 9 bindings:
```csharp
using FreshEngine.Managed;

var engine = new Engine();
if (engine.Initialize())
{
    engine.WindowTitle = "My Voxel Game";
    engine.Run();
}
```

See [../dotnet/README.md](../dotnet/README.md) for .NET 9 integration guide.

### Lua Scripting Support
Lua scripting is available for modding and gameplay logic:
```lua
-- Example: Custom block behavior
function onBlockPlaced(x, y, z, blockType)
    print("Block placed at: " .. x .. ", " .. y .. ", " .. z)
end
```

See [../LUA_INTEGRATION_GUIDE.md](../LUA_INTEGRATION_GUIDE.md) for Lua setup.

### Python Tools
Python scripts for asset generation and tooling:
- `tools/generate_test_sounds.py` - Audio file generation
- Additional tools coming soon

## 🎯 Creating Your Own Gameplay

### Option 1: C++ Development
Modify the engine directly in C++20:

1. Add your gameplay systems to `src/gameplay/`
2. Integrate with existing systems
3. Build with CMake
4. Test in the main executable

### Option 2: .NET 9 Development (Recommended)
Write gameplay in C# with managed bindings:

1. Reference `FreshEngine.Managed.dll`
2. Write your game logic in C#
3. Use the native engine as backend
4. Easier debugging and faster iteration

### Option 3: Lua Scripting
Create gameplay mods with Lua:

1. Write Lua scripts in `scripts/` directory
2. Hook into engine events
3. Define custom behaviors
4. Hot-reload during development

### Option 4: Python Tools
Create development tools in Python:

1. Add scripts to `tools/` directory
2. Use for asset generation and processing
3. Integrate with build pipeline
4. Extend the development workflow

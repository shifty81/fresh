# Viewport Integration - COMPLETE ✅

## Overview
The Win32ViewportPanel provides a dedicated child window for 3D rendering, separating it from editor UI panels. The DirectX rendering pipeline now renders to this viewport child window instead of the main window.

## Implementation Status: COMPLETE ✅

### What Works
- ✅ Win32ViewportPanel class created
- ✅ Viewport child window created during EditorManager initialization
- ✅ Viewport positioned in center-right area (680, 80) with dynamic sizing
- ✅ Menu system and callbacks working correctly
- ✅ Editor UI panels positioned correctly
- ✅ DirectX 11 and 12 swap chain recreation for viewport
- ✅ setViewportWindow() method added to IRenderContext interface
- ✅ recreateSwapChain() method added to IRenderContext interface
- ✅ DirectX renders to viewport child window instead of main window
- ✅ Mouse input coordinates checked against viewport bounds
- ✅ Camera controls restricted to viewport bounds
- ✅ Viewport resize triggers swap chain recreation
- ✅ Camera aspect ratio updates on viewport resize
- ✅ **NEW (2025-12-02)**: Fixed viewport height to avoid console panel overlap
- ✅ **NEW (2025-12-02)**: Added window resize handling for dynamic panel layout
- ✅ **NEW (2025-12-02)**: Implemented onWindowResize in EditorManager
- ✅ **NEW (2025-12-02)**: Viewport and all panels properly resize with main window

## Recent Updates

### Layout and Resize Improvements (2025-12-02) ✅

**Improvements Made:**
1. **Fixed Viewport Height Calculation**
   - **Issue:** Viewport height was calculated as `clientHeight - 80 - 10`, which caused it to overlap with the console panel positioned at y=600.
   - **Fix:** Changed viewport height to `600 - 80 - 10` (510 pixels) to properly fit above the console panel.
   - **File:** `src/editor/EditorManager.cpp` line 537

2. **Added Dynamic Window Resize Handling**
   - **Feature:** Implemented `onWindowResize()` method in EditorManager to dynamically update panel layouts when the main window is resized.
   - **Implementation:** 
     - Added method declaration in `include/editor/EditorManager.h`
     - Implemented method in `src/editor/EditorManager.cpp`
     - Integrated in `src/core/Engine.cpp` update loop to detect window resize and trigger layout updates
   - **Benefits:** Panels (including viewport) now properly resize when users resize the main window, maintaining proper layout and preventing overlaps.

3. **Enhanced Panel Layout Management**
   - Left panels (Inspector, Scene Hierarchy) maintain fixed sizes
   - Bottom panels (Content Browser) maintain fixed size
   - Console panel dynamically resizes width to fill available space
   - Viewport dynamically resizes both width and height to fill available space above console
   - Proper minimum size constraints prevent panels from becoming too small

### Context Menu Position Bug Fix (2025-11-25) ✅

### Context Menu Position Bug - FIXED ✅
**Issue:** Right-click context menus were appearing far to the right and down from the mouse pointer.

**Root Cause:** The `WM_CONTEXTMENU` Windows message provides coordinates that are *already* in screen coordinates. However, the `showContextMenu()` function was calling `ClientToScreen()` on these coordinates, which doubled the offset.

**Fix:** Removed the unnecessary `ClientToScreen()` call from:
- `Win32SceneHierarchyPanel::showContextMenu()`
- `Win32ContentBrowserPanel::showContextMenu()`

### Panel Layout Notes
Current panel positions and behavior:
- **Inspector:** x=10, y=80, w=350, h=500 (fixed size)
- **Scene Hierarchy:** x=370, y=80, w=300, h=500 (fixed size)
- **Content Browser:** x=10, y=600, w=660, h=350 (fixed size)
- **Console:** x=680, y=600, w=dynamic (min 600), h=350 (resizes with window width)
- **Viewport:** x=680, y=80, w=dynamic (min 400), h=dynamic (min 300) (resizes with window size)

**Layout Management:** The viewport is positioned to fill the area above the console panel and to the right of the left column panels. When the window is resized, the `EditorManager::onWindowResize()` method is called to update panel positions and sizes dynamically. This ensures proper layout without overlaps on any window size.

## Implementation Details

### 1. IRenderContext Interface Updates
Added to `include/renderer/RenderContext.h`:
```cpp
virtual bool setViewportWindow(void* viewportHwnd) = 0;
virtual bool recreateSwapChain(int width, int height) = 0;
```

### 2. DirectX 11 Implementation
Added to `src/renderer/backends/DirectX11RenderContext.cpp`:
- `setViewportWindow()` - Stores viewport HWND
- `recreateSwapChain()` - Recreates swap chain for viewport window

### 3. DirectX 12 Implementation
Added to `src/renderer/backends/DirectX12RenderContext.cpp`:
- `setViewportWindow()` - Stores viewport HWND
- `recreateSwapChain()` - Recreates swap chain for viewport window

### 4. Engine Integration
In `src/core/Engine.cpp`:
- `initializeGameSystems()` - Sets viewport window and creates swap chain
- `update()` - Handles viewport resize and mouse-in-viewport checks
- `render()` - Uses viewport dimensions for rendering

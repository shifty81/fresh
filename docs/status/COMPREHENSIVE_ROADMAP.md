## 🎉 Conclusion

The Fresh Voxel Engine is an impressive project that is **70-75% complete** in terms of core functionality. The codebase is well-structured, documented, and tested. The main gaps are:

1. **Critical editor features** (selection, file dialogs) - 4-6 weeks
2. **Resource loading** (actual file I/O) - 2-3 weeks
3. **Scripting integration** (Lua with Sol2) - 3-4 weeks
4. **Gameplay systems** (inventory, crafting) - 6-8 weeks
5. **Future major features** (multiplayer, advanced terrain) - 6+ months

With focused effort on the critical items, the project can reach a solid **v0.3.0** release within 3 months, and a full **v1.0.0** release within 12 months.

The roadmap is clear, the priorities are identified, and the path forward is well-defined. Time to build! 🚀

## 🏗️ Architecture Decisions

### Technology Stack

#### Current
- **Language**: C++20
- **Build System**: CMake 3.20+
- **Graphics APIs**: 
  - DirectX 11/12 (Windows, primary)
  - OpenGL 4.5+ (All platforms, functional)
- **Window/Input**: GLFW 3.3+
- **Math Library**: GLM
- **Audio**: OpenAL-Soft (95% complete)
- **Scripting**: Lua (40% complete)

#### Planned Additions
- **Networking**: ENet or custom UDP (Phase 12)
- **GUI**: ImGui (partial integration complete)
- **Physics**: Custom voxel-based (foundation exists)
- **Testing**: Google Test (some tests exist)
- **Profiling**: Tracy Profiler (Phase 18)

### Design Patterns
- **ECS (Entity Component System)**: For game objects and player management
- **Command Pattern**: Terraforming undo/redo (✅ Implemented)
- **Observer Pattern**: Event system for game state changes
- **Factory Pattern**: Entity creation and chunk generation
- **Singleton Pattern**: Core managers (limited use)
- **Object Pool**: Chunk and entity pooling

### Performance Targets
- **FPS**: 60+ on modern hardware (1080p)
- **Chunk Loading**: < 50ms per chunk
- **Network Latency**: < 100ms player-to-server
- **Memory**: < 2GB for single-player, < 4GB for multiplayer
- **Save/Load**: < 5 seconds for typical world

## 📝 Notes

### Design Philosophy
- **Performance First**: C++ core ensures high performance
- **Modular Design**: Easy to extend and modify
- **Multiplayer-Ready**: Network architecture from the start
- **Mod-Friendly**: Asset system designed for community content
- **Windows-Native**: Optimized for Windows with DirectX 12 support

### Known Limitations
- Windows-only platform (Windows 10+)
- DirectX 12 recommended for best performance
- Server hardware requirements TBD based on player count
- World size limited by disk space and RAM

### Future Considerations
- VR support possibility (Vulkan enables this)
- Console ports (significant work required)
- Steam Workshop integration
- Dedicated server software
- Level editor standalone tool

## 🔧 Technical Implementation Details

### Architecture Decisions:

1. **Separation of Concerns**:
   - UI layer (InventoryPanel, CraftingPanel)
   - Logic layer (InventoryManager)
   - Data layer (rpg::Inventory, rpg::CraftingSystem)

2. **Event-Driven Design**:
   - Callback system for game integration
   - No tight coupling between systems
   - Easy to extend and modify

3. **Windows-Native UI**:
   - Designed for Win32 native controls
   - Placeholder rendering for future implementation
   - Compatible with existing editor framework

4. **Type Safety**:
   - Strong enum types (VoxelType, ResourceType, VoxelMaterial)
   - Compile-time validation
   - Clear intent through types

### Integration Points:

1. **Player System**: Can integrate with Player.h for inventory access
2. **Editor System**: Can integrate with EditorManager for UI panels
3. **Crafting Stations**: Ready for voxel block interaction
4. **Hotbar**: Integrated with input system for quick access
5. **Resource System**: Compatible with asset loading

## 📝 Notes & Observations

### What Worked Well:

1. **Existing Foundation**: The rpg::Inventory and rpg::CraftingSystem were well-designed and easy to extend
2. **Clear Roadmap**: IMMEDIATE_ACTION_PLAN.md provided clear, actionable steps
3. **Modular Design**: New systems integrate cleanly without modifying core engine
4. **Type System**: VoxelTypeInfo provides centralized metadata management

### Challenges Addressed:

1. **Linux Build Environment**: Designed for Windows but structured for cross-compilation
2. **UI Framework**: Created abstract interfaces that can be implemented with Win32
3. **Integration**: Ensured new systems work with existing Player, Editor, and Core systems

### Design Decisions:

1. **Resource Types vs Voxel Types**: Kept separate for flexibility (inventory can hold non-voxel items)
2. **Event Callbacks**: Preferred over observer pattern for simplicity
3. **UI Separation**: UI classes contain data/logic, rendering is separate
4. **Test Strategy**: Integration tests over unit tests to verify full system behavior

## Technical Specifications

### Time System
```
24000 ticks = 1 full in-game day
1000 ticks = 1 in-game hour
20 ticks/second = default progression rate (at 1x speed)
20 minutes real-time = 1 full day (at 1x speed)
```

### Time Periods
```
Midnight:      0 ticks  (12:00 AM)
Sunrise Start: 5000     ( 5:00 AM)
Dawn:          6000     ( 6:00 AM)
Sunrise End:   7000     ( 7:00 AM)
Noon:          12000    (12:00 PM)
Sunset Start:  17000    ( 5:00 PM)
Dusk:          18000    ( 6:00 PM)
Sunset End:    19000    ( 7:00 PM)
```

### Lighting Values
```
Daytime Ambient:    0.8 - 1.0 (bright)
Nighttime Ambient:  0.1 - 0.2 (dark)
Transition Ambient: 0.3 - 0.8 (smooth)
```

## Integration Points

The TimeManager integrates with:

1. **Rendering System** - Provides lighting data for shaders
2. **Gameplay System** - Time-based mechanics and events
3. **UI System** - Time display and controls
4. **Audio System** - Time-based ambient sounds
5. **NPC/Mob System** - Day/night spawn patterns
6. **Weather System** - Time-based weather changes (future)

## How to Use

### Quick Start
```cpp
#include "gameplay/TimeManager.h"

TimeManager timeManager;

// In game loop
void update(float deltaTime) {
    timeManager.update(deltaTime);
    
    // Use lighting data
    float ambient = timeManager.getAmbientLightIntensity();
    glm::vec3 skyColor = timeManager.getSkyColor();
    glm::vec3 sunDir = timeManager.getSunDirection();
}
```

See **DAY_NIGHT_CYCLE_GUIDE.md** for complete usage instructions.

## Conclusion

The day/night cycle implementation is **complete and production-ready**. It provides a solid foundation for time-based gameplay mechanics, realistic lighting, and atmospheric effects in the Fresh Voxel Engine.

**Status:** ✅ READY FOR REVIEW  
**Next Steps:** Integration with rendering system and UI

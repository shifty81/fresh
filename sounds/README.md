# Fresh Voxel Engine - Sound Files

This directory contains audio files used by the Fresh Voxel Engine.

## Test Audio Files

The following test audio files are generated using `tools/generate_test_sounds.py`:

- **test_tone.wav** - 440 Hz sine wave (1 second)
  - Used for testing basic audio playback
  - Standard A note for audio verification

- **beep.wav** - 880 Hz sine wave (0.2 seconds)
  - Short UI sound effect
  - Can be used for button clicks, notifications

- **thud.wav** - 220 Hz sine wave (0.3 seconds)
  - Lower frequency sound
  - Can simulate block placement or footsteps

## Generating Test Sounds

To generate the test audio files, run:

```bash
python3 tools/generate_test_sounds.py
```

This will create all test WAV files in this directory.

## Audio File Format Support

The Fresh Voxel Engine currently supports:

### ✅ Fully Supported
- **WAV** - PCM audio files (8-bit and 16-bit, mono and stereo)

### 🚧 Planned Support
- **OGG** - Ogg Vorbis compressed audio (for music and longer sounds)
- **MP3** - MPEG audio (future consideration)

## Using Audio in the Engine

### Playing 2D Audio

```cpp
fresh::AudioEngine& audio = fresh::AudioEngine::getInstance();
audio.initialize();

// Play a 2D sound
int soundId = audio.play2D("sounds/beep.wav", 1.0f, false);
```

### Playing 3D Spatial Audio

```cpp
// Play a 3D sound at a specific position
glm::vec3 position(10.0f, 0.0f, 5.0f);
int soundId = audio.play3D("sounds/thud.wav", position, 0.8f, false);

// Update listener position (typically from camera/player)
audio.setListenerPosition(playerPosition);
audio.setListenerOrientation(forwardVector, upVector);
```

### Volume Control

```cpp
// Set master volume (0.0 to 1.0)
audio.setMasterVolume(0.8f);

// Set effects volume
audio.setEffectsVolume(0.7f);

// Mute/unmute all audio
audio.setMuted(true);
```

## Testing Audio

Run the audio test example to verify the audio system:

```bash
./build/FreshVoxelEngine  # Run main engine (includes audio)

# Or run the standalone audio test (if built)
# Check examples/audio_test.cpp for details
```

## Adding Your Own Sounds

1. Place WAV files in this `sounds/` directory
2. Reference them in code: `"sounds/your_sound.wav"`
3. Ensure WAV files are:
   - PCM format (uncompressed)
   - 8 or 16-bit
   - Mono or stereo
   - Any sample rate (44.1 kHz recommended)

## Audio File Guidelines

### For Sound Effects
- Format: WAV PCM
- Sample Rate: 44.1 kHz
- Bit Depth: 16-bit
- Channels: Mono (for 3D sounds) or Stereo (for UI sounds)
- Duration: < 2 seconds for most effects

### For Music
- Format: OGG Vorbis (when implemented) or WAV
- Sample Rate: 44.1 kHz
- Bit Depth: 16-bit
- Channels: Stereo
- Duration: Any length

## License and Attribution

Test sounds generated by `generate_test_sounds.py` are procedurally created simple waveforms and are in the public domain.

For any third-party audio files added to this directory, ensure proper licensing and attribution.
